This package was used for learning about UUID.  It's been superseded by the apps-text repo which uses the standard library.

UUID, or GUID, is a 128 bit number used as an ID number.  The same number can be represented in different forms.  This package provides conversion between the hexadecimal form and a non-standard base64 form used at work.
